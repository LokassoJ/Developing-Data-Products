# Developing-Data-Products
This presentation is part of the final project on the course "Developing Data Product". My project is related to the new development of the Covid 19 in different cities and provinces in Belgium as reported by Belgium epidemiological authority. 

The data used in the current analysis are sourced from the : 

1. Sciensano :"https://epistat.sciensano.be/Data/COVID19BE_CASES_MUNI_CUM.csv" (belgium epidimiogical institute),

2. STATBEL : "https://statbel.fgov.be/sites/default/files/files/opendata/bevolking/sectoren/OPENDATA_SECTOREN_2021.xlsx" (file: Population)

3. Open data Wallonie-Bruxelles: "https://www.odwb.be/explore/dataset/code-postaux-belge/table/" : contains GPS localisation for all postal code. 
  
As part of this work, I have created a shiny App and deployed it in Shiny server. Below the link to the shiny server and the related code in gitHub is provided.


Tthe combination the bove dataset led to the file "mydata". 
to run application, one should include this file in his working directory.
